## 1.1 What is the internet?

* Hosts / end systems: devices that are hooked up to the internet 

- End system are connected together by communication links and packet switches

* transmission rate: rate at which the a link transmits data -> measured by bits/second

* Internet Service Providers (ISP): method which end systems access the Internet

* Protocols: control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet
    * Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    *  Internet Protocol (IP)
        - Specifies the format of the packets that are sent and received among routers and end systems
    * TCP/IP : the internets principal protocols

* Internet Standard: created by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
    * IETF standards documents are called requests for comments (RFC)
        - define protocols such as TCP / IP/ HTTP(for the web), and SMTP (for email)

- Internet : a service description
    - can also be described as an infrastructure that provides services to applications 
    * distributed applications: they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other 
    - important internet apps run on end systems -> not on packet switches 

* socket interface: set of rules that the sending program must follow so that the internet can deliver the data to the destination program 

* Network Protocol: defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event

## 1.2 Network Edge

* access network: the network that physically connects an end system to the first router (edge router) on the path from the end system to any other distant end system

- Home access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, and 5G fixed wireless
    - two most popular for home networks: 
        * digital subscriber line ( DSL)
            - 
        * cable
